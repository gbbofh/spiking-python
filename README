This is a python-based implementation of Izhikevich's model of spiking neural
networks, initially published in 2003. This code runs *slowly* -- especially in
comparison to the matlab code which was published alongside the paper detailing
this model.

It was a fun exercise, and I am sure that there are many changes and
improvements that could be made to increase execution time. Some of those
potential changes are discussed in the codes comments. Also in the comments are
fragments of the initial prototype, which ran approximately 2x slower during
initialization.

These scripts require scipy, for its normal and uniform distribution functions,
as well as matplotlib in order to generate plots of the resulting spikes.
